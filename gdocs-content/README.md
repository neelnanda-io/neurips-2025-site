# Google Docs Content for NeurIPS 2025 Workshop

This folder contains markdown-formatted content that you should copy into your Google Docs. 

## How to Use

1. Create a Google Drive folder for your workshop content
2. Create the following Google Docs in that folder:
   - `overview` - Copy content from `overview.md`
   - `cfp` - Copy content from `cfp.md`
   - `schedule` - Copy content from `schedule.md`
   - `speakers` - Copy content from `speakers.md`
   - `organizers` - Copy content from `organizers.md`

3. For each document:
   - Open the corresponding `.md` file in this folder
   - Copy all the content
   - Paste into your Google Doc
   - The Google Docs sync will convert the markdown formatting appropriately

## Important Notes

- The table in `schedule.md` should be created as a proper table in Google Docs
- Bold text (marked with **) should be bolded in Google Docs
- Lists with `-` should be converted to bullet points
- The sync script will handle converting back to markdown for the website

## What Happens Next

Once you've set up the Google Docs and configured the GitHub Action (see main SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md), any changes you make in the Google Docs will automatically sync to the website every hour.
