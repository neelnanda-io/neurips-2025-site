fix: Improve HTML sync to handle parsing errors gracefully

- Add error handling to HTML parser to prevent truncation
- Save debug HTML files for troubleshooting
- Ensure shortcodes are properly preserved with spacing
- Update GitHub Actions to use fixed HTML sync script

The previous HTML parser would fail and truncate content when encountering
certain HTML structures. This version continues parsing even on errors.
