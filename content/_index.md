title: "Mechanistic Interpretability Workshop 2025"
---

This is a 1 day workshop at NeurIPS on mechanistic interpretability, held on December 6th or 7th in the NeurIPS venue at San Diego Convention Center, San Diego, California, Austria. We invite submissions of short (4-pages) and long (8-pages) papers outlining new research in mechanistic interpretability, due May 29th 2025 AoE.

Even though ever larger and more capable machine learning models are being deployed in real-world settings, we still know concerningly little about how they implement their many impressive capabilities. This in turn can make it difficult to rely on these models in high-stakes situations, or to reason about or address cases where said models exhibit undesirable behavior.

One emerging approach for understanding the internals of neural networks is mechanistic interpretability: reverse engineering the algorithms implemented by neural networks into human-understandable mechanisms...
