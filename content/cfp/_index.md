# Call for Papers

We are inviting submissions of short (4 pages) and long (9 pages) papers outlining new research, due August 22, 2025. We welcome papers on any of the following topics (see the Topics for Discussion section for more details and example papers), or anything else where the authors convincingly argue that it moves forward the field of mechanistic interpretability.

* Techniques: Work inventing new mechanistic interpretability techniques, evaluating the quality of existing techniques, or proposing benchmarks and tools for future evaluations.

* Exploratory analysis: Qualitative, biologically-inspired analysis of components, circuits or phenomena inside neural networks.

* Decoding superposition: Work that deepens our understanding of the hypothesis that models activations are represented in superposition, and explores techniques to decode superposed activations, such as sparse autoencoders.

* Applications of interpretability: Can we study jailbreaks/hallucinations/other interesting real-world phenomena of LLMs? Where are places where mech interp provides value, in a fair comparison with e.g. linear probing or finetuning baselines?

* Scaling and automation: How can we reduce the dependence of mechanistic interpretability on slow, subjective and expensive human labor? How much do our current techniques scale?

* Basic science: There are many fundamental mysteries of model internals, and we welcome work that can shed any light on them: Are activations sparse linear combinations of features? Are features universal? Are circuits and features even the right way to think about models?

We also welcome work that furthers the field of mechanistic interpretability in less standard ways, such as by providing rigorous negative results, or open source software, models or datasets that may be of value to the community, coding tutorials, distillations of key and poorly explained concepts, or position pieces discussing future use cases of mechanistic interpretability or that bring clarification to complex topics such as "what is a feature?".

## Reviewing and Submission Policy

[All submissions must be made via OpenReview (link forthcoming). Please use the NeurIPS 2025 LaTeX Template](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1751994531069836&usg=AOvVaw3nulgxvcIRYVVlB0kq3_9_) for all submissions (no need for a .

Submissions are non-archival. We are happy to receive submissions that are also undergoing peer review elsewhere at the time of submission, but we will not accept submissions that have already been previously published or accepted for publication at peer-reviewed conferences or journals. Submission is permitted for papers presented or to be presented at other non-archival venues (e.g. other workshops).

Reviewing for our workshop is double blind: reviewers will not know the authors' identity (and vice versa). Both short (max 4 page) and long (max 8 page) papers allow unlimited pages for references and appendices, but reviewers are not expected to read these. Evaluation of submissions will be based on the originality and novelty, the technical strength, and relevance to the workshop topics. Notifications of acceptance will be sent to applicants by email.

## Prizes

* Best paper prize: $1000

* Second place: $500

* Third place: $250

* Honorable mentions: Up to 5, no cash prize

## Important Information

Note: You will require an OpenReview account to submit. If you do not have an institutional email (e.g. a .edu address), OpenReview moderation can take up to 2 weeks. Please make an account well before the deadline if this applies to you.
