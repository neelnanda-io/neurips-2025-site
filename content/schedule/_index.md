Session Details
Survey Talk
Mechanistic interpretability is a fast-moving field, and we anticipate attendees from a variety of backgrounds. Since many researchers are interested in either entering the field or making use of it in their own work, we will begin the workshop with an introductory survey talk to establish relevant background.
Discussion Topics
We will host discussions on a range of current topics in mechanistic interpretability. These will be facilitated by workshop organisers with the aim of bringing together workshop participants interested in the same research questions and fostering new collaborations.
Poster Sessions
All papers will give an in-person poster presentation. Authors who cannot attend may upload a poster to the workshop website. We plan to have two poster sessions to accommodate the volume of submissions and give authors a chance to see other work.
