1,4,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Spotlight),"Same Task, Different Circuits: Disentangling Modality-Specific Mechanisms in VLMs","Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the circuits---the task-specific computational sub-graphs---in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it."
2,25,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),Quiet Feature Learning in Algorithmic Tasks,"We train Transformer-based language models on ten foundational algorithmic tasks and observe pronounced phase transitions in their loss curves that deviate from established power-law scaling trends. Over large ranges of compute, the validation loss barely improves, then abruptly decreases. Probing the models’ internal representations reveals that quiet features are learned prior to any decrease in task loss. These quiet features represent intermediate algorithmic computations that do not by themselves improve the output loss. Ablation experiments demonstrate that individual quiet features are causally necessary for task performance. Our results demonstrate that substantial representational progress can remain hidden beneath an apparently flat loss curve, challenging the prevailing use of cross‑entropy as a proxy for learning and motivating richer diagnostics for monitoring model training."
3,35,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Spotlight),Emergence of Linear Truth Encodings in Language Models,"Recent probing studies reveal that large language models exhibit linear subspaces that separate true from false statements, yet the mechanism behind their emergence is unclear. We introduce a transparent, one-layer transformer toy model that reproduces such truth subspaces end-to-end and exposes one concrete route by which they can arise. We study one simple setting in which truth encoding can emerge: a data distribution where factual statements co-occur with other factual statements (and vice-versa), encouraging the model to learn this distinction in order to lower the LM loss on future tokens. We corroborate this pattern with experiments in pretrained language models. Finally, in the toy setting we observe a two-phase learning dynamic: networks first memorize individual factual associations in a few steps, then---over a longer horizon---learn to linearly separate true from false, which in turn lowers language-modeling loss. Together, these results provide both a mechanistic demonstration and an empirical motivation for how and why linear truth representations can emerge in language models."
4,37,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),Decomposing Attention To Find Context-Sensitive Neurons,"We study transformer language models, analyzing attention heads whose attention
 patterns are spread out, and whose attention scores depend weakly on content. We
 argue that the softmax denominators of these heads are stable when the underlying
 token distribution is fixed. By sampling softmax denominators from a ""calibration
 text"", we can combine together the outputs of multiple such stable heads in the first
 layer of GPT2-Small, approximating their combined output by a linear summary
 of the surrounding text. This approximation enables a procedure where from the
 weights alone - and a single calibration text - we can uncover hundreds of first
 layer neurons that respond to high-level contextual properties of the surrounding
 text, including neurons that didn’t activate on the calibration text."
5,50,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Spotlight),Circuit-Tracer: A New Library for Finding Feature Circuits,"Feature circuits aim to shed light on LLM behavior by identifying the features that are causally responsible for a given LLM output, and connecting them into a directed graph, or *circuit*, that explains how both each feature and each output arose. However, performing circuit analysis is challenging: the tools for finding, visualizing, and verifying feature circuits are complex and spread across libraries. To facilitate feature-circuit finding, we introduce `circuit-tracer`, an open-source library for efficient identification of feature circuits. `circuit-tracer` provides an integrated pipeline for finding, visualizing, annotating, and performing interventions on such circuits, tested with various model sizes, up to 14B parameters. We make `circuit-tracer` available to both developers and end users, via integration with tools such as Neuronpedia, which provides a user-friendly interface."
6,57,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),Equivalent Linear Mappings of Large Language Models,"Despite significant progress in transformer interpretability, an understanding of the computational mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge. Many approaches interpret a network's hidden representations but remain agnostic about how those representations are generated. We address this by mapping LLM inference for a given input sequence to an equivalent and interpretable linear system which reconstructs the predicted output embedding with relative error below $10^{-13}$ at double floating-point precision, requiring no additional model training. We exploit a property of transformer decoders wherein every operation (gated activations, attention, and normalization) can be expressed as $A(x) \cdot x$, where $A(x)$ represents an input-dependent linear transform and $x$ preserves the linear pathway. To expose this linear structure, we strategically detach components of the gradient computation with respect to an input sequence, freezing the $A(x)$ terms at their values computed during inference, such that the Jacobian yields an equivalent linear mapping. This ``detached’’ Jacobian of the model reconstructs the output with one linear operator per input token, which is shown for Qwen 3, Gemma 3 and Llama 3, up to Qwen 3 14B. These linear representations demonstrate that LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where the singular vectors can be decoded to interpretable semantic concepts. The computation for each intermediate output also has a linear equivalent, and we examine how the linear representations of individual layers and their attention and multilayer perceptron modules build predictions, and use these as steering operators to insert semantic concepts into unrelated text. Despite their expressive power and global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through equivalent linear representations that reveal low-dimensional semantic structures in the next-token prediction process. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/jamesgolden1/equivalent-linear-LLMs/ } ."
7,73,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),Feature interactions in sparse crosscoders from compact proofs,"Dictionary learning methods like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and crosscoders attempt to explain a model by decomposing its activations into independent features. Interactions between features hence induce errors in the reconstruction. We formalize this intuition via compact proofs and make four contributions. First, we show how, \textit{in principle}, a compact proof of model performance can be constructed using a crosscoder. Second, we show that an error term arising in this proof can naturally be interpreted as a measure of inteaction between crosscoder features and provide an explicit expression for the interaction term in the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers. We then provide two applications of this new interaction measure. In our third contribution we show that the interaction term itself can be used as a differentiable loss penalty. Applying this penalty, we can achieve ``computationally sparse"" crosscoders that retain $60\%$ of MLP performance when only keeping a single feature at each datapoint and neuron, compared to $10\%$ in standard crosscoders. Finally, we show that clustering according to our interaction measure provides semantically meaningful feature clusters. Code is available at the following repository: https://github.com/JasonGross/crosscoders-feature-interactions"
8,79,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),Multiple Streams of Knowledge Retrieval: Enriching and Recalling in Transformers,"When an LLM learns a relation during finetuning (e.g., new movie releases, corporate mergers, etc.), where does this information go? Is it extracted when the model processes an entity, recalled just-in-time before a prediction, or are there multiple separate heuristics? Existing localization approaches (e.g. activation patching) are ill-suited for this analysis because they tend to replace parts of the residual stream, potentially deleting information.
 To fill this gap, we propose dynamic weight grafting between fine-tuned and pre-trained language models to show that fine-tuned language models both (1) ""enrich"" with entity and relation information learned during finetuning while processing entities and (2) ""recall"" this information in later layers while generating predictions. In some cases, models need both of these pathways to correctly generate finetuned information while, in other cases, a single ""enrichment"" or ""recall"" pathway alone is sufficient. We examine the necessity and sufficiency of these information pathways, examining what layers they occur at, how much redundancy they exhibit, and which model components are involved---finding that the ""recall"" pathway occurs via both task-specific attention mechanisms and an entity extraction step in the output of the attention and the feedforward networks at the final layers before next token prediction."
9,113,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),	 Motifs in Attention Patterns of Large Language Models,"Attention patterns in Large Language Models often exhibit clear structure, and analysis of these structures may provide insight into the functional roles of the attention heads that produce these patterns. However, there is little work addressing ways to analyze these structures, identify features to classify them, or categorize attention heads using the patterns they produce. To address this gap, we 1) create a meaningful embedding of attention *patterns*; 2) use this embedding of attention patterns to embed the underlying attention *heads* themselves in a meaningful latent space; and 3) investigate the correspondence between known classes of attention heads, such as name mover heads and induction heads, with the groupings emerging in our embedding of attention heads."
10,117,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),Mechanistic evidence that motif-gated domain recognition drives contact prediction in protein language models,"Protein language models (pLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on protein structure and function prediction tasks, yet their internal computations remain opaque. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been used on pLMs to recover sparse model features, called latents, whose activations correlate with known biological concepts. However, prior work has not established which latents are causally necessary for pLM performance on downstream tasks. Here, we adapt causal activation patching to the pLM setting and perform it in SAE latent space to extract the minimal circuit responsible for contact prediction accuracy in two case study proteins. Preserving only a tiny fraction of latent--token pairs (0.022\% and 0.015\%) is sufficient to retain contact prediction accuracy in a residue unmasking experiment. We observe a two-step computation in which early-layer motif detectors respond to short local sequence patterns, gating mid-to-late domain detectors which are selective for protein domains and families. Path-level ablations confirm the causal dependence of domain detector latents on upstream motif detector latents. To evaluate these components quantitatively, we introduce two diagnostics: a Motif Conservation Test and a hypothesis-driven Domain Selectivity Test. All candidate motif-detector latents pass the conservation test, and 18/23 candidate domain-detector latents achieve AUROC~$\ge$~0.95. To our knowledge, this is the first circuits-style causal analysis for pLMs, pinpointing the motifs, domains, and motif-domain interactions that drive contact prediction in two specific case studies. The framework introduced herein will enable future mechanistic dissection of protein language models."
11,125,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),The Impossibility of Inverse Permutation Learning in Transformer Models,"We study the problem of inverse permutation learning in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original (``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval, multiple choice QA and in-context learning.
 

 Our primary contribution is an impossibility result: under weak assumptions, we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample complexity. 
 

 We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental role of the causal attention mask, and suggests a gap between the expressivity of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture. The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply duplicating the input yields a construction under which inverse permutation learning is possible. We conjecture that this result may suggest an alternative mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate ``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models."
12,129,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Spotlight),RelP: Faithful and Efficient Circuit Discovery in Language Models via Relevance Patching,"Activation patching is a standard method in mechanistic interpretability for localizing the components of a model responsible for specific behaviors, but it is computationally expensive to apply at scale. Attribution patching offers a faster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced reliability in deep, highly non-linear networks.
 In this work, we introduce Relevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution patching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the layers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local propagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or improved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only two forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency while improving faithfulness.
 We validate RelP across a range of models and tasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than standard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and MLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for MLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by RelP.
 Additionally, we compare the faithfulness of sparse feature circuits identified by RelP and Integrated Gradients (IG), showing that RelP achieves comparable faithfulness without the extra computational cost associated with IG."
13,131,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Spotlight),Path Channels and Plan Extension Kernels: a Mechanistic Description of Planning in a Sokoban RNN,"We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with model-free reinforcement learning to play the box-pushing game Sokoban. We find that the RNN stores future moves (plans) as activations in particular channels of the hidden state, which we call _path channels_. A high activation in a particular location means that, when a box is in that location, it will get pushed in the channel's assigned direction.
 We examine the convolutional kernels between path channels and find that they encode the change in position resulting from each possible action, thus representing part of a learned _transition model_.
 The RNN constructs plans by starting at the boxes and goals.
 These kernels, _extend_ activations in path channels forwards from boxes and backwards from the goal.
 Negative values are placed in channels at obstacles. This causes the extension kernels to propagate the negative value in reverse, thus pruning the last few steps and letting an alternative plan emerge; a form of backtracking. 
 Our work shows that a precise understanding of the plan representation allows us to directly understand the bidirectional planning-like algorithm learned by model-free training in more familiar terms."
14,160,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),Transformers Don’t Need LayerNorm at Inference Time: Scaling LayerNorm Removal to GPT-2 XL and Implications for Mechanistic Interpretability,"Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
 transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training stability are
 well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood. Additionally, LN
 layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing additional nonlinearities
 and increasing the interconnectedness of individual model components. Here, we
 show that all LN layers can be removed via fine-tuning from every GPT-2 model
 with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03 cross-entropy loss for GPT-
 2 XL). Thus, LN is not essential at inference to maintain comparable performance
 in language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
 removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
 models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
 Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct logit
 attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components, while the
 accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We also confirm
 that GPT-2’s “confidence neurons” are inactive in the LN-free models. Our work
 clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing that GPT-2-class
 models can function without LN layers. We hope that our LN-free analogs of the
 GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise interpretability research and
 improve our understanding of language models."
15,174,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Spotlight),Reverse-Engineering Memory in DreamerV3: From Sparse Representations to Functional Circuits,"Understanding how reinforcement learning (RL) agents with recurrent neural network architectures encode and use memory remains an open question in the field of interpretability. In this work, we investigate these internal memory dynamics of DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art model-based deep RL agent. Our analysis reveals that DreamerV3 relies on sparse memory representations and on small internal subnetworks (circuits) to store and act on memory, with only a small subset of the original model parameters sufficient to control goal-directed behavior. We show that using a differentiable circuit extraction method, we can identify these subnetworks that retain full task performance with as little as 0.16% of the original parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these sparse circuits emerge early in training and can retroactively improve undertrained models when applied as binary masks. Finally, we develop a gradient-based model editing approach that leverages these circuits for a reliable post hoc modification of the agent's behavior, achieving an average edit success rate of 90%. Our work demonstrates how sparse memory circuits provide a powerful lever for understanding and editing deep RL systems."
16,273,Morning,1 Circuits and Reverse Engineering,Accept (Poster),Shared Memorization Structures in Transformers Revealed by Loss Curvature,"We characterize how memorization is represented in Transformer networks. We find that supervised memorization-removal models trained on a targeted set also suppress untargeted memorization, implying a shared representational structure for memorized data. Building on links between memorization and loss curvature, we show this structure is disentangled in weight space when expressed in the eigenbasis of the (K-FAC) Fisher information. Using this decomposition, we propose an unsupervised parameter-ablation method that outperforms a supervised method in suppression of memorization, yields more natural generations in LMs, and improves generalization in label-noisy ViTs. Our work expands the understanding of verbatim memorization in neural networks, and points to practical mitigation methods for suppressing it in trained models."
17,24,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Sparse but Wrong: Incorrect L0 Leads to Incorrect Features in Sparse Autoencoders,"Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations, meant to correspond to interpretable concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is L0: how many SAE features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares SAE algorithms using sparsity-reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a free parameter with no single correct value aside from its effect on reconstruction. In this work we study the effect of L0 on SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set correctly, the SAE fails to disentangle the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we present a proxy metric that can help guide the search for the correct L0 for an SAE on a given training distribution. We show that our method finds the correct L0 in toy models and coincides with peak sparse probing performance in LLM SAEs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that L0 must be set correctly to train SAEs with correct features."
18,27,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Evaluating SAE interpretability without explanations,"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and transcoders have become important tools for machine learning interpretability. However, measuring how interpretable they are remains challenging, with weak consensus about which benchmarks to use. Most evaluation procedures start by producing a single-sentence explanation for each latent. These explanations are then evaluated based on how well they enable an LLM to predict the activation of a latent in new contexts. This method makes it difficult to disentangle the explanation generation and evaluation process from the actual interpretability of the latents discovered. In this work, we adapt existing methods to assess the interpretability of sparse coders, with the advantage that they do not require generating natural language explanations as an intermediate step. This enables a more direct and potentially standardized assessment of interpretability. Furthermore, we compare the scores produced by our interpretability metrics with human evaluations across similar tasks and varying setups, offering suggestions for the community on improving the evaluation of these techniques."
19,29,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Sparse Autoencoders Trained on the Same Data Learn Different Features,"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a useful tool for uncovering human-interpretable features in the activations of large language models (LLMs). While some expect SAEs to find the true underlying features used by a model, our research shows that SAEs trained on the same model and data, differing only in the random seed used to initialize their weights, identify different sets of features. For example, in an SAE with 131K latents trained on a feedforward network in Llama 3 8B, only 30\% of the features were shared across different seeds. We observed this phenomenon across multiple layers of three different LLMs, two datasets, and several SAE architectures. While ReLU SAEs trained with the L1 sparsity loss showed greater stability across seeds, SAEs using the state-of-the-art TopK activation function were more seed-dependent, even when controlling for the level of sparsity. Our results suggest that the set of features uncovered by an SAE should be viewed as a pragmatically useful decomposition of activation space, rather than an exhaustive and universal list of features ""truly used"" by the model."
20,32,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Spotlight),Overcoming Sparsity Artifacts in Crosscoders to Interpret Chat-Tuning,"Model diffing is the study of how fine-tuning changes a model's representations and internal algorithms. Many behaviors of interest are introduced during fine-tuning, and model diffing offers a promising lens to interpret such behaviors. Crosscoders are a recent model diffing method that learns a shared dictionary of interpretable concepts represented as latent directions in both the base and fine-tuned models, allowing us to track how concepts shift or emerge during fine-tuning. Notably, prior work has observed concepts with no direction in the base model, and it was hypothesized that these model-specific latents were concepts introduced during fine-tuning. However, we identify two issues which stem from the crosscoders L1 training loss that can misattribute concepts as unique to the fine-tuned model, when they really exist in both models. We develop Latent Scaling to flag these issues by more accurately measuring each latent's presence across models. In experiments comparing Gemma 2 2B base and chat models, we observe that the standard crosscoder suffers heavily from these issues. Building on these insights, we train a crosscoder with BatchTopK loss and show that it substantially mitigates these issues, finding more genuinely chat-specific and highly interpretable concepts. We recommend practitioners adopt similar techniques. Using the BatchTopK crosscoder, we successfully identify a set of chat-specific latents that are both interpretable and causally effective, representing concepts such as false information and personal question, along with multiple refusal-related latents that show nuanced preferences for different refusal triggers. Overall, our work advances best practices for the crosscoder-based methodology for model diffing and demonstrates that it can provide concrete insights into how chat-tuning modifies model behavior."
21,53,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Feature-Guided SAE Steering for Refusal-Rate Control using Contrasting Prompts,"Large Language Model (LLM) deployment requires guiding the LLM to recognize and not answer unsafe prompts while complying with safe prompts. Previous methods for achieving this require adjusting model weights along with other expensive procedures. While recent advances in Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have enabled interpretable feature extraction from LLMs, existing approaches lack systematic feature selection methods and principled evaluation of safety-utility tradeoffs. We explored using different steering features and steering strengths using Sparse Auto Encoders (SAEs) to provide a solution. Using an accurate and innovative contrasting prompt method with the AI-Generated Prompts Dataset from teknium/OpenHermes-2p5-Mistral-7B and Air Bench eu-dataset to efficiently choose the best features in the model to steer, we tested this method on Llama-3 8B. We conclude that using this method, our approach achieves an 18.9\% improvement in safety performance while simultaneously increasing utility by 11.1\%, demonstrating that targeted SAE steering can overcome traditional safety-utility tradeoffs when optimal features are identified through principled selection methods."
22,54,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Compressed Computation: Dense Circuits in a Toy  Model of the Universal-AND Problem,"Neural networks are capable of superposition - representing more features than there are dimensions. Recent work considers the analogous concept for computation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions. But there has been little investigation into whether these circuits can be learned in practice.
 

 In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND problem which computes the AND of all $m\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs. The hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is restricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called compressed computation.
 

 We find that the training process finds a simple solution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully dense - every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit naturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency. It is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and extends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain the found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the theoretical constructions at low sparsity.
 

 Our findings shed light on the types of circuits that models like to form and the flexibility of the superposition representation. This contributes to a broader understanding of network circuitry and interpretability."
23,58,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Group Equivariance Meets Mechanistic Interpretability: Equivariant Sparse Autoencoders,"Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven useful in disentangling the opaque activations of neural networks, primarily large language models, into sets of interpretable features. However, adapting them to domains beyond language, such as scientific data with group symmetries, introduces challenges that can hinder their effectiveness. We show that incorporating such group symmetries into the SAEs yields features more useful in downstream tasks. More specifically, we train autoencoders on synthetic images and find that a single matrix can explain how their activations transform as the images are rotated. Building on this, we develop *adaptively equivariant SAEs* that can adapt to the base model's level of equivariance. These adaptive SAEs discover features that lead to superior probing performance compared to regular SAEs, demonstrating the value of incorporating symmetries in mechanistic interpretability tools."
24,86,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Vector Arithmetic in Concept and Token Subspaces,"In order to predict the next token, LLMs must represent semantic and surface-level information about the current word. Previous work identified two types of attention heads that disentangle this information: (i) Concept induction heads, which copy word meanings, and (ii) Token induction heads, which copy literal token representations (Feucht et al., 2025). We show that these heads can be used to identify subspaces of model activations that exhibit coherent semantic structure. Specifically, when we transform hidden states using the attention weights of concept heads, we are able to more accurately perform parallelogram arithmetic (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the resulting hidden states, e.g., showing that *Athens* - *Greece* + *China* = *Beijing*. This transformation allows for much higher nearest-neighbor accuracy (80%) than direct use of raw hidden states (47%). Analogously, we show that token heads allow for transformations that reveal surface-level word information in hidden states, allowing for operations like *coding* - *code* + *dance* = *dancing*."
25,92,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),"Adversarial Examples Are Not Bugs, They Are Superposition","Adversarial examples—inputs with imperceptible perturbations that fool neural networks—remain one of deep learning's most perplexing phenomena despite nearly a decade of research. While numerous defenses and explanations have been proposed, there is no consensus on the fundamental mechanism. One underexplored hypothesis is that \textit{superposition}, a concept from mechanistic interpretability, may be a major contributing factor, or even the primary cause. We present four lines of evidence in support of this hypothesis, greatly extending prior arguments by Elhage et al. (2022): (1) superposition can theoretically explain a range of adversarial phenomena, (2) in toy models, intervening on superposition controls robustness, (3) in toy models, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition, and (4) in ResNet18, intervening on robustness (via adversarial training) controls superposition."
26,105,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Capturing Polysemanticity with PRISM: A Multi-Concept Feature Description Framework,"Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior. Within the context of large language models (LLMs) for natural language processing (NLP), current automated neuron-level feature description methods face two key challenges: limited robustness and the assumption that each neuron encodes a single concept (monosemanticity), despite increasing evidence of polysemanticity. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework specifically designed to capture the complexity of features in LLMs. Unlike approaches that assign a single description per neuron, common in many automated interpretability methods in NLP, PRISM produces more nuanced descriptions that account for both monosemantic and polysemantic behavior. We apply PRISM to LLMs and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score)."
27,108,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Decomposing Representation Space into Interpretable Subspaces with Unsupervised Learning,"Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it possible to find these ""natural"" subspaces in a purely unsupervised way? Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to ""variables"" used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing. Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding model internals and building circuits."
28,116,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Spotlight),Bimodality of sparse autoencoder features is still there and can be fixed,"Sparse autoencoders (SAE) are a widely used method for decomposing LLM activations into a dictionary of interpretable features. We observe that this dictionary often exhibits a bimodal distribution, which can be leveraged to categorize features into two groups: those that are monosemantic and those that are artifacts of SAE training. The cluster of noninterpretable or polysemantic features undermines the purpose of sparse autoencoders and represents a waste of potential, akin to dead features. This phenomenon is prevalent across autoencoders utilizing both ReLU and alternative activation functions. We propose a novel training method to address this issue and demonstrate that this approach achieves improved results on several benchmarks from SAEBench."
29,137,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Spotlight),Adversarial Attacks Leverage Interference Between Features in Superposition,"Fundamental questions remain about why adversarial examples arise in neural networks. In this paper, we argue that adversarial vulnerability can emerge from *efficient* information encoding in networks. Specifically, we show that superposition - where networks represent more features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial perturbations leverage interference between superposed features to craft attacks, making attack patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific vulnerability. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled superposition, we establish that superposition *suffices* to create adversarial vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning process or non-robust inputs."
30,140,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders: Select-and-Project for Fairness and Control from Encoder Features Alone,"Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have proven valuable due to their ability to provide interpretable and steerable representations. Current debiasing methods based on SAEs manipulate these sparse activations presuming that feature representations are housed within decoder weights. We challenge this fundamental assumption and introduce an encoder-focused alternative for representation debiasing, contributing three key findings: (i) we highlight an unconventional SAE feature selection strategy, (ii) we propose a novel SAE debiasing methodology that orthogonalizes input embeddings against encoder weights, and (iii) we establish a performance-preserving mechanism during debiasing through encoder weight interpolation. Our **S**election and **P**rojection framework, termed **S\&P TopK**, surpasses conventional SAE usage in fairness metrics by a factor of up to $3.2$ and advances state-of-the-art test-time VLM debiasing results by a factor of up to $1.8$ while maintaining downstream performance."
31,148,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Neurons Speak in Ranges: Breaking Free from Discrete Neuronal Attribution,"Interpreting the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for improving their trustworthiness and utility. Prior work has primarily focused on mapping individual neurons to discrete semantic concepts. However, such mappings struggle to handle the inherent polysemanticity in LLMs, where individual neurons encode multiple, distinct concepts. Through a comprehensive analysis of both encoder and decoder-based LLMs across diverse datasets, we observe that even highly salient neurons, identified via various attribution techniques for specific semantic concepts, consistently exhibit polysemantic behavior. Importantly, activation magnitudes for fine-grained concepts follow distinct, often Gaussian-like distributions with minimal overlap. This observation motivates a shift from neuron attribution to range-based interpretation. We hypothesize that interpreting and manipulating neuron activation ranges would enable more precise interpretability and targeted interventions in LLMs. To validate our hypothesis, we introduce NeuronLens, a novel range-based interpretation and manipulation framework that provides a finer view of neuron activation distributions to localize concept attribution within a neuron. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeuronLens significantly reduces unintended interference, maintaining precise manipulation of targeted concepts, outperforming neuron attribution."
32,227,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Spotlight),Measuring Sparse Autoencoder Feature Sensitivity,"Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by examining their activating examples, which are often ``monosemantic"" and align with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal *feature sensitivity*: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate feature sensitivity. 
 Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with the same semantic properties as a
 feature’s activating examples. We then test whether the feature activates on these generated texts.
 We demonstrate that sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features and SAE architectures."
33,238,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Spotlight),Signal in the Noise: Polysemantic Interference Transfers and Predicts Cross-Model Influence,"Polysemanticity—where individual neurons encode multiple unrelated features—is a well-known characteristic of large neural networks and remains a central challenge in the interpretability of language models. At the same time, its implications for model safety are also poorly understood. Leveraging recent advances in sparse autoencoders, we investigate the polysemantic structure of two small models (Pythia-70M and GPT-2-Small) and evaluate their vulnerability to targeted, covert interventions at the prompt, feature, token, and neuron levels. Our analysis reveals a consistent polysemantic topology shared across both models. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this structure can be exploited to mount effective intervention on two larger, black-box instruction-tuned models (Llama-3.1-8B/70B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-Instruct). These findings suggest not only the generalizability of the intervention strategies, but also point to a stable and transferable polysemantic structure that persists across architectures and training regimes."

We introduce Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), which extend Matryoshka SAEs by (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling‐based approximations of prior nested SAE methods. Theoretically, we show that OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in settings of sparse dictionary learning where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, we show that OSAEs can help improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines."
35,284,Morning,"2 Features, Superposition, and SAEs",Accept (Poster),Superposition in Mixture of Experts,"Superposition allows neural networks to represent far more features than they have dimensions. Previous work has explored how superposition is affected by attributes of the data. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are used in state-of-the-art large language models and provide a network parameter that affects superposition: network sparsity. We investigate how network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts) in MoEs affects superposition and feature representation. We extend Elhage et al. [2022]’s toy model framework to MoEs and develop new metrics to understand superposition across experts. Our findings demonstrate that MoEs consistently exhibit greater monosemanticity than their dense counterparts. Unlike dense models that show discrete phase transitions, MoEs exhibit continuous phase transitions as network sparsity increases. We define expert specialization through monosemantic feature representation rather than load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature combinations and maintain specialization when initialized appropriately. Our results suggest that network sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing performance, challenging the view that interpretability and capability are fundamentally at odds."
36,229,Afternoon,3 Probing and Representation Engineering,Accept (Poster),Interpretability at the Network Level: Prior-Guided Drift Diffusion for Neural Circuit Analysis,"Interpretability at the neuron level has provided valuable insights into how individual units respond to specific features and patterns. To advance interpretability at the network level, we propose treating networks as generative models to probe their learned statistical priors. We introduce Prior-Guided Drift Diffusion (PGDD), which accesses the implicit statistical structure networks acquire during training. PGDD iteratively refines inputs according to the network's learned priors, essentially probing what patterns emerge from the network's internal statistical knowledge. For adversarially robust networks, this leverages implicit denoising operators shaped by robust training. For standard networks, our extension uses gradient smoothing techniques to stabilize the generative process. Applying this method during early training reveals that networks appear to acquire rich semantic representations well before achieving reliable classification performance. This demonstrates a dissociation between internal representation learning and classification performance, where networks develop structured knowledge before they can reliably use it. Our training-free approach provides direct access to this latent representational structure in the models we tested."

We test activation probes in this ""few vs. thousands"" regime on spam and honesty detection tasks. For our tasks, training with many negative examples is on average more positive-sample-efficient than balanced training for small numbers (1-10) of positive samples. We also find that LLM upsampling can provide a performance boost equivalent to roughly doubling the number of real positive samples, though excessive upsampling hurts performance. Finally, we show a positive scaling trend, where larger models are more positive-sample-efficient to probe. Our findings suggest we should leverage the large number of negative samples available to amplify the signal from rare but critical misalignment examples."

Identifying effective steering locations is especially challenging when evaluation depends on a human or auxiliary LM, as such judgments are costly and yield only coarse feedback on the impact of an intervention. We introduce a signal for selecting steering locations by: (1) constructing contrastive responses exhibiting successful and unsuccessful steering, (2) computing the difference in generation probabilities between the two, and (3) approximating the causal effect of hidden activation interventions on this probability difference. We refer to this lightweight localization procedure as contrastive causal mediation (CCM). Across three case studies—refusal, sycophancy, and style transfer—we evaluate three CCM variants against probing and random baselines. All variants consistently outperform baselines in identifying attention heads suitable for steering. These results highlight the promise of causally grounded mechanistic interpretability for fine-grained model control."

We introduce SAE-ception, a method that iteratively incorporates features extracted by a sparse autoencoder (SAE) as auxiliary targets in the training loop. Across three distinct settings — an MLP on MNIST, a vision transformer (ViT-H) on CIFAR-10, and ConvNeXt-V2 on ImageNet-1k — our method led to substantial gains in the clustering and separability of learned SAE features. These gains were evidenced by several metrics, such as improved silhouette scores and Davies-Bouldin indices. The effect on monosemanticity and task performance, however, is context-dependent. On the simpler MLP, the approach is a clear success, improving not only monosemanticity in both the base model and the SAE but also increasing the base model's final task accuracy by over 2.5%. On ViT-H, SAE-ception doubles the monosemanticity of the SAE — as measured by the uncertainty coefficient (U) — after a single cycle with only a 0.09% drop in task accuracy, but the base model's monosemanticity remains largely unchanged. While the gains in feature clustering and separability persist on ConvNeXt-V2, monosemanticity metrics remained largely stagnant: U shifted from a baseline of 0.28 to 0.31. We conclude that SAE-ception reliably enhances features for post-hoc analysis, making it a valuable tool for practitioners, though its ability to disentangle the base model's representations depends on the specific architecture and task. Determining the conditions under which it can consistently improve the internal monosemanticity of a base model remains a key direction for future exploration."
40,135,Morning,3 Probing and Representation Engineering,Accept (Poster),Steering Out-of-Distribution Generalization with Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning,"Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) can lead to unintended out-of-distribution generalization. Standard approaches to this problem rely on modifying the training data, for example by adding data that better specify the intended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce Concept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages interpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without needing to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target distribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding to undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear projections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended generalizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks, including emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow task generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions. Without any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses by 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution. Overall, CAFT represents a novel approach for steering LLM generalization without modifying training data."
41,144,Morning,3 Probing and Representation Engineering,Accept (Poster),Watch the Weights: Unsupervised monitoring and control of fine-tuned LLMs,"The releases of powerful open-weight large language models (LLMs) are often not accompanied by access to their full training data. Existing interpretability methods, particularly those based on activations, often require or assume distributionally similar data. This is a significant limitation when detecting and defending against novel potential threats like backdoors, which are by definition out-of-distribution. In this work, we introduce a new method for understanding, monitoring and controlling fine-tuned LLMs that interprets weights, rather than activations, thereby side stepping the need for data that is distributionally similar to the unknown training data. We demonstrate that the top singular vectors of the weight difference between a fine-tuned model and its base model correspond to newly acquired behaviors. By monitoring the cosine similarity of activations along these directions, we can detect salient behaviors introduced during fine-tuning with high precision. For backdoored models that bypasses safety mechanisms when a secret trigger is present, our method stops up to 100% of attacks with a false positive rate below 1.2%. For models that have undergone unlearning, we detect inference on erased topics with accuracy up to 95.42% and can even steer the model to recover ""unlearned"" information. Besides monitoring, our method also shows potential for pre-deployment model auditing: by analyzing commercial instruction-tuned models (OLMo, Llama, Qwen), we are able to uncover model-specific fine-tuning focus including marketing strategies and Midjourney prompt generation."

In reality, LLMs encode information retained during training as internal probabilistic knowledge. This study examines existing methods for probing the veracity of that knowledge and identifies several flawed underlying assumptions. To address these flaws, we introduce sAwMIL (Sparse-Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a multiclass probing framework that combines multiple-instance learning with conformal prediction. sAwMIL leverages internal activations of LLMs to classify statements as true, false, or neither. We evaluate sAwMIL across 16 open-source LLMs, including default and chat-based variants, on three new curated datasets. Our results show that (1) common probing methods fail to provide a reliable and transferable veracity direction and, in some settings, perform worse than zero-shot prompting; (2) truth and falsehood are not encoded symmetrically; and (3) LLMs encode a third type of signal that is distinct from both true and false."
43,154,Morning,3 Probing and Representation Engineering,Accept (Poster),Learning to Steer: Input-dependent Steering for Multimodal LLMs,"Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. 
 However, it remains largely underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector. Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static baselines. We will open-source our code."

This opacity limits trust and safe deployment in robotics (i.e., embodied AI). In this work, we show that discrete robot actions can be steered by identifying a small number of meaningful features inside the residual stream of a VLA policy. Using a Magma-style model with a ConvNeXt vision encoder and a LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct decoder in the SimplerEnv simulator, we learn behavior directions from contrastive pairs of inputs that differ only in the target action (e.g., open vs. close gripper). Specifically, we use a sparse autoencoder (SAE) fitted to the decoder’s residual stream to construct steering vectors in latent space, which are then decoded back and applied at inference time. This intervention reliably shifts the model’s action choice while preserving overall coherence. Our analysis shows that steering is effective but not perfectly disentangled due to inadvertent activations of related features during steering. These results provide the first evidence that latent-space techniques can steer embodied multimodal policies without retraining. More broadly, this work highlights that mechanistic interpretability techniques (e.g., SAE) can provide handles to control action-level behavior of complex agents."
45,306,Morning,3 Probing and Representation Engineering,Accept (Poster),Comparing Clinical and General LLMs on Knowledge Boundaries and Robustness,"Large language models (LLMs) often know the correct answer internally even when their expressed output is wrong, which raises questions about how this knowledge is represented and whether domain adaptation changes it. We study how continued pretraining on domain corpora affects what a model knows and how reliably it can use this knowledge, with a focus on biomedical data. Comparing a general-purpose LLM with a clinical LLM obtained through continued pretraining on clinical text, we find that both retain similar levels of probe-accessible factual knowledge, yet the stability of self-monitoring signals is substantially reduced after domain pretraining. For example, the variance of error-detection performance nearly doubles in the biomedical model. An analysis of embedding geometry suggests that this reduced stability is associated with representations becoming more isotropic, with anisotropy decreasing from about 0.47 to 0.37. These results indicate that continued domain pretraining tends to reorganize rather than expand what the model knows, and can unintentionally weaken the consistency of error-detection signals, with implications for building reliable domain-adapted LLMs."

However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We demonstrate this convergence by extracting a ""misalignment direction'' from one fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it, we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate misalignment more generally."

 In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token.
 Building on these insights, we introduce Dyslexify - a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, Dyslexify improves performance by up to 22.06\% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1\%, and demonstrate its utility in a medical foundation model for skin lesion diagnosis. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition."

Dissecting Role Conflicts in LLM Instruction Following,"Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale dataset. Linear probing shows conflict–decision signals are encoded early, with system–user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system–user cases but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that, despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive alignment methods."

These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions. However, these monitors may themselves become training signals, for example, by using problematic samples found in deployment to retrain models. This raises an important question: can models learn to evade such monitors? To evaluate this capability, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to evade latent-space monitors while maintaining their blackbox behaviour. We apply RL-Obfuscation to Language Models ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate their Evasion Success Rate against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack while more holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, for these vulnerable monitors, models trained to evade a single static monitor can generalise to evade other unseen monitors. We also find that the models can be trained to conditionally bypass latent-space monitors on only certain inputs. Finally, we study how the models bypass these monitors and find that the model can learn to repurpose tokens to have different internal representations."

However, the fundamental mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in how harmful behaviour is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behaviour. Our results indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviours may be organized into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioural outcomes, we hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability and weight-based interventions."
51,9,Morning,5 Reasoning Models,Accept (Poster),LLM Pretraining with Continuous Concepts,"Next token prediction has been the standard training objective used in large language model pretraining. Representations are learned as a result of optimizing for token-level perplexity. We propose Continuous Concept Mixing (CoCoMix), a novel pretraining framework that combines discrete next token prediction with continuous concepts. Specifically, CoCoMix predicts ``continuous concepts'' learned from a pretrained sparse autoencoder and mixes them into the model's hidden state by interleaving with token hidden representations. Through experiments on multiple benchmarks, including language modeling and downstream reasoning tasks, we show that CoCoMix is more sample efficient and consistently outperforms standard next token prediction and knowledge distillation. We find that combining both concept learning and interleaving in an end-to-end framework is critical to performance gains. Furthermore, CoCoMix enhances interpretability and steerability by allowing direct inspection and modification of the predicted concept, offering a transparent way to guide the model’s internal reasoning process."
52,12,Morning,5 Reasoning Models,Accept (Poster),Mapping Faithful Reasoning in Language Models,"Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a general framework for tracing how a model’s internal stance evolves with respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in ""easy"" cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative reasoning, whereas in ``hard'' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners."

However, reliably attributing generated content to specific context segments, context attribution, remains challenging due to the computationally intensive nature of current methods, which often require extensive fine-tuning or human annotation. In this work, we introduce a novel Jensen–Shannon Divergence driven method to Attribute Response to Context (ARC-JSD), enabling efficient and accurate identification of essential context sentences without additional fine-tuning or surrogate modelling. Evaluations on a wide range of RAG benchmarks, such as TyDi QA, Hotpot QA, and Musique, using instruction-tuned LLMs in different scales demonstrate superior accuracy and significant computational efficiency improvements compared to the previous surrogate-based method. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis reveals specific attention heads and multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers responsible for context attribution, providing valuable insights into the internal workings of RAG models, and how they affect RAG behaviours."

While even very small embedding dimensions are sufficient for models to achieve high accuracy, larger dimensions yield representations that are more faithful, consistent, and robust. In particular, higher embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal representation and leads to better interpretability. After hundreds of experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens; and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that transformers build structured internal world models and that model size improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release metrics and analyses that can be reused to probe similar tasks."

  We study this question by training a model using DeepSeek R1's recipe on the CountDown task.
  We leverage the fact that preference tuning leads to mode collapse, yielding a model that always produces highly structured chain-of-thought sequences.
  With this setup, we do top-down and bottom-up analyses to reverse-engineer how the model verifies its outputs.
  Top-down, we find Gated Linear Unit (GLU) weights encoding verification-related tokens, such as ``success'' or ``incorrect''.
  Bottom-up, we find that ``previous-token heads'' are mainly responsible for self-verification in our setup.
  Our analyses meet in the middle: drawing inspiration from inter-layer communication channels, we use the identified GLU weights to localize as few as six attention heads that can disable self-verification, pointing to a necessary component of a potentially larger verification circuit.
  Finally, we verify that similar verification components exist in our base model and a general reasoning DeepSeek-R1 model."
56,78,Morning,5 Reasoning Models,Accept (Spotlight),Thought Anchors: Which LLM Reasoning Steps Matter?,"Current frontier large-language models rely on reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Many existing interpretability methods are limited in this area, as standard methods have been designed to study single forward passes of a model rather than the multi-token computational steps that unfold during reasoning. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We introduce a black-box method that measures each sentence's counterfactual importance by repeatedly sampling replacement sentences from the model, filtering for semantically different ones, and continuing the chain of thought from that point onwards to quantify the sentence's impact on the distribution of final answers. We discover that certain sentences can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the reasoning trace and final answer. We term these sentences ""thought anchors."" These are generally planning or uncertainty management sentences, and specialized attention heads consistently attend from subsequent sentences to thought anchors. We further show that examining sentence-sentence causal links within a reasoning trace gives insight into a model's behavior. Such information can be used to predict a problem's difficulty and the extent different question domains involve sequential or diffuse reasoning. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate that our techniques together provide a practical toolkit for analyzing reasoning models by conducting a detailed case study of how the model solves a difficult math problem, finding that our techniques yield a consistent picture of the reasoning trace's structure. We provide an open-source tool thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods on further problems. The convergence across our methods shows the potential of sentence-level analysis for a deeper understanding of reasoning models."

 However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. 
 We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B -- a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces -- process abstract structural information.
 On Mystery Blocksworld -- a semantically obfuscated planning domain -- we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning.
 The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names.
 Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss.
 We find that one of the factors driving reasoning model performance is in-context refinement of token representations, which we dub Fluid Reasoning Representations."
58,186,Morning,5 Reasoning Models,Accept (Spotlight),Just-in-time and distributed task representations in language models,"Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate \emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and \emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on ''transferrable'' task representations---vector representations that can restore task contexts in another instance of the model, even without the full prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, when more examples are provided in the context, transferrable task representations successfully condense evidence. This allows better transfer of task contexts and aligns well with the performance improvement. However, this evidence accrual process exhibits strong locality along the sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens---despite task identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'', such as a semantically-independent subtask. For longer and composite tasks, models rely on more temporally-distributed representations. This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of just-in-time computational process that language models use to perform new tasks on the fly."

In this work, we show that the majority of new capabilities in reasoning models can be elicited by small, single-rank changes to base model parameters, with many of these changes being interpretable. Specifically, we use a rank-1 LoRA to create a minimal parameter adapter for \texttt{Qwen-2.5-32B-Instruct} which recovers 73-90\% of reasoning-benchmark performance compared to a full-parameter finetune. We find that the activations of this LoRA are as interpretable as MLP neurons, and fire for reasoning-specific behaviors. Finally, we train a sparse autoencoder on the entire activation state of this LoRA and identify fine-grained and monosemantic features. Our findings reveal how reasoning performance can arise largely from minimal changes to base model parameters. More broadly, our work shows that parameter-efficient training methods can be used as a targeted lens for uncovering fundamental insights about language model behavior and dynamics."
60,210,Morning,5 Reasoning Models,Accept (Poster),Language Models use Lookbacks to Track Beliefs,"How do language models (LMs) represent characters' beliefs, especially when those beliefs may differ from reality? This question lies at the heart of understanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze LMs' ability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal mediation and abstraction. We construct a dataset, CausalToM, consisting of simple stories where two characters independently change the state of two objects, potentially unaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovers a pervasive algorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables the LM to recall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds each character-object-state triple together by co-locating their reference information, represented as Ordering IDs (OIs), in low-rank subspaces of the state token's residual stream. When asked about a character's beliefs regarding the state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the correct state OI and then the answer lookback retrieves the corresponding state token. When we introduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the other, we find that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the relation between the observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility lookback, this ID is used to retrieve information about the observed character and update the observing character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into belief tracking mechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering ToM reasoning in LMs."
61,8,Morning,6 Multimodal Models,Accept (Poster),Latent Crystallographic Microscope: Probing the Emergent Crystallographic Knowledge in Large Language Models,"Recent works are exploring the application of large language models to materials discovery, from property prediction to structure generation. However, the internal mechanisms through which LLMs perform crystallographic understanding and reasoning tasks remain unexplored. This lack of mechanistic understanding prevents the development of principled approaches for reliable materials discovery. We introduce the Latent Crystallography Microscope (LCM), a mechanistic interpretability framework for reverse-engineering crystallographic reasoning in large language models. We conduct three experiments mapping the progression from mechanistic understanding to controlled intervention. First, format recognition and property extraction tasks reveal that LLMs excel at direct metadata retrieval but struggle with geometric computations, indicating reliance on pattern matching over true geometric reasoning. Second, activation patching identifies task-specific neural circuits where attention heads mediate information routing while MLP blocks encode abstract crystallographic rules, with computational onset progressing to later layers as task complexity increases. Third, onset layer interventions during structure generation demonstrate that these mechanistic insights enable targeted neural modifications, though intervention effectiveness remains material-system dependent. Our analysis locates crystallographic computations to specific neural circuits, providing intervention targets for future work. This work maps the computational mechanisms underlying crystallographic tasks while demonstrating current limitations in leveraging these insights for reliable materials generation."
62,17,Morning,6 Multimodal Models,Accept (Poster),When Seeing Overrides Knowing: Disentangling Knowledge Conflicts in Vision-Language Models,"Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly combine both visual and textual information to perform complex tasks. However, conflicts between their internal knowledge and external visual input can lead to hallucinations and unreliable predictions. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal commonsense knowledge. Through logit inspection, we identify a small set of attention heads that mediate this conflict. By intervening in these heads, we can steer the model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Our results show that attention from these heads effectively locates image regions that influence visual overrides, providing a more precise attribution compared to gradient-based methods."
63,20,Morning,6 Multimodal Models,Accept (Poster),Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Models,"Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance the interpretability of deep learning networks by aligning the features extracted from images with natural concepts. However, existing CBMs are constrained in their ability to generalize beyond a fixed set of predefined classes and the risk of non-concept information leakage, where predictive signals outside the intended concepts are inadvertently exploited. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Model (MM-CBM) to address these issues and extend CBMs into CLIP. MM-CBM utilizes dual Concept Bottleneck Layers (CBLs) to align both the image and text embeddings into interpretable features. This allows us to perform new vision tasks like classification with unseen classes or image retrieval in an interpretable way. Compared to existing methods, MM-CBM achieves up to 43.96\% accuracy improvement on average across four standard benchmarks. Our method maintains high accuracy, staying within ~5\% of black-box model performance while offering greater interpretability."
64,76,Morning,6 Multimodal Models,Accept (Poster),Uncovering Object Localization Mechanisms in VLMs,"Visually-grounded language models (VLMs) are highly effective in linking visual and textual information, yet they often struggle with basic classification and localization tasks. While classification mechanisms have been studied more extensively, the processes that support object detection remain less clear. In this work, we analyze foundational VLMs and show that image tokens corresponding to the object directly contain the information required for localization. We find that the model applies a containerization mechanism: it uses object-related tokens to define spatial boundaries, while largely discarding semantic context. Our analysis further reveals that this information is processed in the early to middle layers of the language model and that classification and detection rely on shared mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate that spatial grounding does not come solely from positional encodings in the visual backbone, but rather from residual positional signals combined with the language model’s ability to infer spatial order from token sequences."
65,80,Morning,6 Multimodal Models,Accept (Poster),Interpreting ResNet-based CLIP via Neuron-Attention Decomposition,"We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic, represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these observations for two applications. First, we utilize the pairs for training-free semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second, we use the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units and that such units can be utilized for downstream tasks."

Does this mean that FLUX has learned abstract representations of the letters it is generating? We investigate the implicit representations of inpainting diffusion models by printing characters onto an evenly spaced grid and prompting the model to fill in masked characters. By probing the latent representations of these character grids in various components of the model, we find evidence of generalizable letter representations in middle transformer layers that suggest a notion of letter identity consistent across fonts."
67,102,Morning,6 Multimodal Models,Accept (Poster),Automated Detection of Visual Attribute Reliance with a Self-Reflective Agent,"When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object detector."
68,120,Morning,6 Multimodal Models,Accept (Poster),Head Pursuit: Probing Attention Specialization in Multimodal Transformers,"Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in text-generative models specialize in certain semantic or visual attributes. We reinterpret the established practice of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find that editing as few as 1\% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably impact targeted concepts in the model output."
69,325,Morning,6 Multimodal Models,Accept (Poster),Towards Understanding Multimodal Fine-Tuning: A Case Study into Spatial Features,"Contemporary Vision–Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on a wide range of tasks by pairing a vision encoder with a pre-trained language model, fine-tuned for visual–text inputs. Yet despite these gains, it remains unclear how language backbone representations adapt during multimodal training and when vision-specific capabilities emerge. In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLMs adaptation process. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to ""see"". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially-grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only. This methodology enhances the interpretability of multimodal training and provides a foundation for understanding and refining how pretrained language models acquire vision-grounded capabilities."
70,11,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention,"As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000 tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time complexity $O(T log T)$ and linear space complexity $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query while preserving the model's next-token behavior. By tuning block size and $k$, practitioners can finely control the resolution (e.g. sentence level vs paragraph level) and amount of pruning. We apply Stream to long chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning 97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER needle-in-a-haystack benchmark, Stream preserves the critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns, computing salience scores, and tracing information flow without terabytes of caches. By making long-context interpretability feasible on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

 represented by individual neurons in deep networks. While algorithms such as Network Dissection and CLIP-Dissect achieve great empirical success, a rigorous theoretical foundation remains absent, which is crucial to enable trustworthy and reliable explanations. In this work, we observe that neuron identification can be viewed as the \textit{inverse process of machine learning}, which allows us to derive guarantees for neuron explanations. Based on this insight, we present the first theoretical analysis of two fundamental challenges: (1) **Faithfulness:** whether the identified concept faithfully represents the neuron's underlying function and (2) **Stability:** whether the identification results are consistent across probing datasets. We derive generalization bounds for widely used similarity metrics (e.g. accuracy, AUROC, IoU) to guarantee faithfulness, and propose a bootstrap ensemble procedure that quantifies stability along with **BE** (Bootstrap Explanation) method to generate concept prediction sets with guaranteed coverage probability. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the practicality of our method, providing an important step toward trustworthy neuron identification."
72,56,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),Beyond the Final Layer: Intermediate Representations for Better Multilingual Calibration in Large Language Models,"Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale, systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence. In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE), which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy LLMs by looking beyond the final layer."
73,77,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),Pinpointing Attention-Causal Communication in Language Models,"The attention mechanism plays a central role in the computations performed by transformer-based models, and understanding the reasons why heads attend to specific tokens can aid in interpretability of language models. Although considerable work has shown that models construct low-dimensional feature representations, little work has explicitly tied low-dimensional features to the attention mechanism itself. In this paper we work to bridge this gap by presenting methods for identifying \emph{attention-causal communication}, meaning low-dimensional features that are written into and read from tokens, and that have a provable causal relationship to attention patterns. The starting point for our method is prior work [1-3] showing that model components make use of low dimensional communication channels that can be exposed by the singular vectors of QK matrices. Our contribution is to provide a rigorous and principled approach to finding those channels and isolating the attention-causal signals they contain. We show that by identifying those signals, we can perform prompt-specific circuit discovery in a single forward pass. Further, we show that signals can uncover unexplored mechanisms at work in the model, including a surprising degree of global coordination across attention heads."
74,97,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),What Affects the Effective Depth of Large Language Models?,"The scaling of large language models (LLMs) emphasizes increasing depth, yet performance gains diminish with added layers. Prior work introduces the concept of ""effective depth"", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty.
 First, we analyze the model behavior of the Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B–32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems.
 Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting. Our code is released at https://github.com/AheadOFpotato/what_affects_effective_depth."
75,99,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Spotlight),Mechanistic evaluation of Transformers and state space models,"State space models (SSMs) for language modelling promise an efficient and performant alternative to quadratic-attention Transformers, yet show variable performance on recalling basic information from the context. While performance on synthetic tasks like Associative Recall (AR) can point to this deficiency, behavioural metrics provide little information as to why---on a mechanistic level---certain architectures fail and others succeed. To address this, we conduct experiments on AR and find that only Transformers and Based SSM models fully succeed at AR, with Mamba a close third, whereas the other SSMs (H3, Hyena) fail. We then use causal interventions to explain why. We find that Transformers and Based learn to store key--value associations in-context using induction heads. By contrast, the SSMs compute these associations only at the last state, with only Mamba succeeding because of its short convolution component. To extend and deepen these findings, we introduce Associative Treecall (ATR), a synthetic task similar to AR based on PCFG induction. ATR introduces language-like hierarchical structure into the AR setting. We find that all architectures learn the same mechanism as they did for AR, and the same three models succeed at the task. These results reveal that architectures with similar accuracy may still have substantive differences, motivating the adoption of mechanistic evaluations."

While these interventions aim to modify specific knowledge (e.g., removing virology content), their effects often propagate to related but unintended areas (e.g., allergies). Due to lack of standardized tools, existing evaluations typically compare performance on targeted versus unrelated general tasks, overlooking this broader collateral impact called the ""ripple effect"". 
 

 We introduce **RippleBench**, a benchmark for systematically measuring how interventions affect semantically related knowledge. Using **RippleBench**, built on top of a Wikipedia-RAG pipeline for generating multiple-choice questions, we evaluate eight state-of-the-art unlearning methods. We find that all methods exhibit non-trivial accuracy drops on topics increasingly distant from the unlearned knowledge, each with distinct propagation profiles. To support ongoing research, we release our codebase for on-the-fly ripple evaluation, along with the benchmark: RippleBench-Bio (12,895 unique topics)."
77,121,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval,"We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems, with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability."

Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore, classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses, demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination detection in RAG systems.

We extend our focus and propose to mechanistically *forward engineer* using our framework based on Concept Bottleneck Models. In the context of long-term time series forecasting, we modify the training objective to encourage a model to develop representations which are similar to predefined, interpretable concepts using Centered Kernel Alignment. This steers the bottleneck components to learn the predefined concepts, while allowing other components to learn other, undefined concepts. We apply the framework to the Vanilla Transformer, Autoformer and FEDformer, and present an in-depth analysis on synthetic data and on a variety of benchmark datasets. We find that the model performance remains mostly unaffected, while the model shows much improved interpretability. Additionally, we verify the interpretation of the bottleneck components with an intervention experiment using activation patching."
80,126,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),Do We Always Need Sampling? Eliciting Numerical Predictive Distributions of LLMs Without Auto-Regression,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been successfully applied to regression tasks—such as time series forecasting and tabular prediction—by leveraging their in-context learning abilities. However, their autoregressive decoding process is ill-suited to continuous-valued outputs, and obtaining predictive distributions over numerical targets typically requires repeated sampling, leading to high computational cost. In this work, we investigate whether distributional properties of LLM predictions can be recovered without explicit autoregressive generation. To this end, we study a set of regression probes trained to predict statistical functionals (e.g., mean, median, quantiles) of the LLM’s numerical output distribution directly from its internal representations. Our results suggest that LLM embeddings carry informative signals about numerical uncertainty, and that summary statistics of their predictive distributions can be approximated with reduced computational overhead. This investigation opens up new questions about how LLMs internally encode uncertainty in numerical tasks, and about the feasibility of lightweight alternatives to sampling-based approaches for uncertainty-aware numerical predictions."
81,136,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),Toward a Theory of Generalizability in LLM Mechanistic Interpretability Research,"Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies extrapolating this finding to other LLMs—and along which dimensions might such generalizations hold? I propose five potential *axes of correspondence* along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate this framework, I analyze ""1-back attention heads"" (components attending to previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M, 70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the *developmental trajectories* of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms."
82,145,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),Do Natural Language Descriptions of Model Activations Convey Privileged Information?,"Recent interpretability methods have proposed to translate LLM internal representations into natural language descriptions using a second $\textit{verbalizer}$ LLM. This is intended to illuminate how the target model represents and operates on inputs. But do such $\textit{activation verbalization}$ approaches actually provide $\textit{privileged}$ knowledge about the internal workings of the target model, or do they merely convey information about its inputs? We critically evaluate popular verbalization methods across datasets used in prior work and find that they can succeed at benchmarks without any access to target model internals, suggesting that these datasets may not be ideal for evaluating verbalization methods. We then run controlled experiments which reveal that verbalizations often reflect the parametric knowledge of the verbalizer LLM which generated them, rather than the knowledge of the target LLM whose activations are decoded. Taken together, our results indicate a need for targeted benchmarks and experimental controls to rigorously assess whether verbalization methods provide meaningful insights into the operations of LLMs."
83,156,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),Open-Vocabulary Natural-Language Explanations of LLM Activations via Soft Prompts,"We introduce Latent-to-Explanation Likelihood (L2EL), a simple interface that translates internal activations of a large language model (LLM) into a short natural-language explanation without changing the underlying LLM. Given a single hidden representation (e.g., a residual-stream activation at one token and layer), a tiny mapper produces a continuous ``soft prompt'' that conditions a frozen LLM to generate an explanation. We train the mapper with weak supervision from sparse autoencoder (SAE) explanations: for each latent we sample one natural language feature description among the active SAE features and optimize the soft prompt such that the LLM emits that description when conditioned on it. At test time, L2EL supports (i) generation of concise free-form explanations and (ii) probing by scoring arbitrary hypotheses through their conditional likelihood. This reframes interpretability as conditional language modeling over explanations, enabling an open vocabulary and calibration through likelihoods. As a proof-of-concept, we train L2EL on Gemma-2-2B using GemmaScope SAEs. Our results indicate that L2EL generates reasonable explanations and can be used to probe hidden activations using natural language. L2EL preserves the strengths of language as an expressive medium while requiring only a small learned interface and no modifications to the LLM."

 The majority of the studies in this direction only focus on the improvements in performance of the LMs on different benchmarks, whereas LMs are considered black boxes. Besides this, a handful of works attempt to understand the role of attention layers in the code LMs.
 Nonetheless, feed-forward layers remain under-explored which consist of two-thirds of a typical transformer model's parameters. 
 In this work, we attempt to gain insights into the inner workings of code language models by examining the feed-forward layers. 
 We focus on examining the organization of stored concepts, the editability of these concepts, and the roles of different layers and input context size variations for output generation.
 Our empirical findings demonstrate that lower layers capture syntactic patterns while higher layers encode abstract concepts and semantics. 
 We show concepts of interest can be edited within feed-forward layers without compromising code LM performance.
 We anticipate these findings will facilitate better understanding, debugging, and testing of code LMs."
85,230,Morning,"7 Miscellaneous, Tools, and Dynamics",Accept (Poster),Control and Predictivity in Neural Interpretability,"For the goals of mechanistic interpretability, correlational methods are typically easy to scale and use, and can provide strong predictivity of Neural Network (NN) representations. However, they can lack causal fidelity which can limit their relevance to NN computation and behavior. Alternatively, causal approaches can offer strong behavioral control via targeted interventions, making them superior for understanding computational cause and effect. However, what if causal methods use out-of-distribution representations to produce their effects? Does this raise concerns about the faithfulness of the claims that can be made about the NN's native computations? In this work, we explore this possibility of this representational divergence. We ask to what degree do causally intervened representations diverge from the native distribution, and in what situations is this divergence acceptable? Using Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) as a case study, we first demonstrate the existence of causally intervened representational divergence in interventions that provide strong behavioral control, and we show that stronger behavioral control can correlate with more divergent intervened representations. We then provide a theoretical discussion showing sufficient ways for this divergence to occur in both innocuous and potentially pernicious ways. We then provide a theoretical demonstration that causal interventions typically assume principles of additivity, calling into question the use of nonlinear methods for causal manipulations. Lastly, for cases in which representational divergence is undesirable, we demonstrate how to incorporate a counterfactual latent loss to constrain intervened representations to remain closer to the native distribution. Together, we use our results to suggest that although causal methods are superior for most interpretability goals, a complete account of NN representations balances computational control with neural predictivity, with the optimal weighting depending on the goals of the research."
