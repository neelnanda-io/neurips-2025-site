content: "## Workshop Goals\nThe mechanistic interpretability field benefits from\
  \ a rich diversity of approaches\u2014from rigorous mathematical analysis to large-scale\
  \ empirical studies, from reverse-engineering a model via bottom-up circuit analysis,\
  \ to assisting behavioral analysis via top-down analysis of model representations.\
  \ But all are unified by the belief that there is meaning and structure to be found\
  \ inside neural networks, and that this is worth studying. \n\nThis diversity reflects\
  \ the field's breadth and the many valid paths toward understanding neural networks.\
  \ But those in these different sub-communities often lack natural venues to meet.\
  \ Our workshop aims to: \n* **Showcase cutting-edge research** across all approaches\
  \ to mechanistic interpretability\n* **Foster cross-pollination** between different\
  \ methodological traditions\n* **Identify convergent insights** emerging from diverse\
  \ research programs\n* **Build understanding** between different perspectives, research\
  \ communities, and terminologies\n* **Welcome newcomers** by providing clear entry\
  \ points into the field\n\nWe hope to explore points of active debate in the field\
  \ including: \n* How researchers should prioritise between gathering evidence via\
  \ rigorous qualitative analysis vs performance on benchmarks/real-world tasks\n\
  * What are the implications of new paradigms like reasoning models for the field\u2019\
  s priorities?\n* Whether the field\u2019s north star should be complete reverse\
  \ engineering, achieving high-level understanding, or something else entirely\n\
  * How reliable or useful are popular methods such as [sparse](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html)\
  \ [autoencoders](https://adamkarvonen.github.io/machine_learning/2024/06/11/sae-intuitions.html),\
  \ and how much should we [prioritize](https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/negative-results-for-sparse-autoencoders-on-downstream-tasks-and-deprioritising-sae-research-6cadcfc125b9)\
  \ them compared to other research directions?\n* The relative merits of a perspective\
  \ of curiosity driven basic science vs working towards specific goals\n* How important\
  \ are unsupervised techniques with the potential to surprise us, such as [transcoders](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html),\
  \ compared to simple supervised techniques such as [probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12452).\n\
  \nIn this workshop, we hope to bring together researchers from across these many\
  \ perspectives and communities\u2014along with skeptics, experts in adjacent fields,\
  \ and those simply curious to learn more\u2014to facilitate healthy discussion and\
  \ move towards a greater mutual understanding as a field. \n\nThrough our [call\
  \ for papers](https://mechinterpworkshop.com/cfp/), we hope to facilitate the sharing\
  \ of work in this fast-moving field, across all of these axes, and especially work\
  \ that helps to bridge these gaps. **We welcome any submissions that seek to further\
  \ our ability to use the internals of models to achieve understanding, regardless\
  \ of how unconventional the approach may be.** Please see the [call for papers page](https://mechinterpworkshop.com/cfp/)\
  \ for further details and particular topics of interest. \n\nWe welcome attendees\
  \ from all backgrounds, regardless of your prior research experience or if you have\
  \ work published at this workshop. Note that while you do not need to be registered\
  \ for the NeurIPS main conference to attend this workshop, you do need to be registered\
  \ for the NeurIPS workshop track. No further registration needed, seating is first-come\
  \ first-served. \n## Learning More\nHere are some resources you may find useful\
  \ for learning more about the mechanistic interpretability field and performing\
  \ research: \n* We recommend starting with the review paper <span class=\"open-problems-text\"\
  >[Open](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16496) Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability</span>\
  \ for an overview of the field\n* [Ferrando et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00208)\
  \ is a good primer on the key techniques of the field\n* The [ARENA coding tutorials](https://arena-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/)\
  \ are a great place to learn how to implement these techniques in practice\n* Neel\
  \ Nanda\u2019s [guide](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/jP9KDyMkchuv6tHwm/how-to-become-a-mechanistic-interpretability-researcher)\
  \ on how to skill up, learn how to do research, and pursue a career as a researcher\
  \ in the field\n\nResources for doing research \n* Popular libraries include: [TransformerLens](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens)\
  \ (PyTorch, best for <=9B models), [nnsight](https://github.com/ndif-team/nnsight)\
  \ (PyTorch, more flexible and scales better), [Penzai](https://github.com/google-deepmind/penzai)\
  \ (Jax)\n* The [Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark](https://mib-bench.github.io/)\n\
  * The [Gemma Scope Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05147) ([interactive\
  \ tutorial](http://neuronpedia.org/gemma-scope))\n\nRelevant online communities:\
