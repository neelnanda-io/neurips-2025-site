content: "## Workshop Goals\nThe mechanistic interpretability field benefits from\
  \ a rich diversity of approaches\u2014from rigorous mathematical analysis to large-scale\
  \ empirical studies, from reverse-engineering a model via bottom-up circuit analysis,\
  \ to assisting behavioral analysis via top-down analysis of model representations.\
  \ But all are unified by the belief that there is meaning and structure to be found\
  \ inside neural networks, and that this is worth studying. \n\nThis diversity reflects\
  \ the field's breadth and the many valid paths toward understanding neural networks.\
  \ But those in these different sub-communities often lack natural venues to meet.\
  \ Our workshop aims to: \n* **Showcase cutting-edge research** across all approaches\
  \ to mechanistic interpretability\n* **Foster cross-pollination** between different\
  \ methodological traditions\n* **Identify convergent insights** emerging from diverse\
  \ research programs\n* **Build understanding** between different perspectives, research\
  \ communities, and terminologies\n* **Welcome newcomers** by providing clear entry\
  \ points into the field\n\nWe hope to explore points of active debate in the field\
  \ including: \n* How researchers should prioritise between gathering evidence via\
  \ rigorous qualitative analysis vs performance on benchmarks/real-world tasks\n\
  * What are the implications of new paradigms like reasoning models for the field\u2019\
  s priorities?\n* Whether the field\u2019s north star should be complete reverse\
  \ engineering, achieving high-level understanding, or something else entirely\n\
  * How reliable or useful are popular methods such as [sparse](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752374196781277&usg=AOvVaw0IuQh24U7FN6jeNiN-hmzg)\
  \ [autoencoders](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://adamkarvonen.github.io/machine_learning/2024/06/11/sae-intuitions.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752374196781429&usg=AOvVaw1KNj_qOn27S5D4KQq8jKkF),\
  \ and how much should we [prioritize](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/negative-results-for-sparse-autoencoders-on-downstream-tasks-and-deprioritising-sae-research-6cadcfc125b9&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752374196781584&usg=AOvVaw0rQMAO3VYj30r9FjTQwIgr)\
  \ them compared to other research directions?\n* The relative merits of a perspective\
  \ of curiosity driven basic science vs working towards specific goals\n* How important\
  \ are unsupervised techniques with the potential to surprise us, such as [transcoders](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752374196782075&usg=AOvVaw3ldB_A0KmBttthbvw9vKBj),\
  \ compared to simple supervised techniques such as [probing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12452&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752374196782214&usg=AOvVaw3AQUb5m3EVa2lKKGpZK6MB).\n\
  \nIn this workshop, we hope to bring together researchers from across these many\
  \ perspectives and communities\u2014along with skeptics, experts in adjacent fields,\
  \ and those simply curious to learn more\u2014to facilitate healthy discussion and\
  \ move towards a greater mutual understanding as a field. \n\nThrough our [call\
  \ for papers](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mechinterpworkshop.com/cfp/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752374196782778&usg=AOvVaw0XxvkNLkvGwBH3EvqHfi8h),\
  \ we hope to facilitate the sharing of work in this fast-moving field, across all\
  \ of these axes, and especially work that helps to bridge these gaps. **We welcome\
  \ any submissions that seek to further our ability to use the internals of models\
  \ to achieve understanding, regardless of how unconventional the approach may be.**\
