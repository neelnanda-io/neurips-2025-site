content: "## Workshop Goals\n\nThe mechanistic interpretability field benefits from\
  \ a rich diversity of approaches\u2014from rigorous mathematical analysis to large-scale\
  \ empirical studies, from reverse-engineering a model via bottom-up circuit analysis,\
  \ to assisting behavioral analysis via top-down analysis of model representations.\
  \ But all are unified by the belief that there is meaning and structure to be found\
  \ inside neural networks, and that this is worth studying.\n\n\nThis diversity reflects\
  \ the field's breadth and the many valid paths toward understanding neural networks.\
  \ But those in these different sub-communities often lack natural venues to meet.\
  \ Our workshop aims to:\n\n\n* Showcase cutting-edge research\_across all approaches\
  \ to mechanistic interpretability\n\n* Foster cross-pollination\_between different\
  \ methodological traditions\n\n* Identify convergent insights\_emerging from diverse\
  \ research programs\n\n* Build understanding between different perspectives, research\
  \ communities, and terminologies\n\n* Welcome newcomers\_by providing clear entry\
  \ points into the field\n\nWe hope to explore points of active debate in the field\
  \ including:\n\n\n* How to prioritise between gathering evidence via rigorous qualitative\
  \ analysis vs performance on benchmarks/real-world tasks\n\n* Whether to aim for\
  \ complete reverse engineering, for achieving high-level understanding, or something\
  \ else entirely\n\n* How reliable or useful are popular methods such as [sparse](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752149274363977&usg=AOvVaw2hYZJ_FEHqKuHJOeDCc36n)[autoencoders](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://adamkarvonen.github.io/machine_learning/2024/06/11/sae-intuitions.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752149274364213&usg=AOvVaw3RKZcPOWPbQPm96MjgBPMP),\
  \ and how much should we [prioritize](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/negative-results-for-sparse-autoencoders-on-downstream-tasks-and-deprioritising-sae-research-6cadcfc125b9&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752149274364373&usg=AOvVaw1q4Q7xk0jmf4nNTczE-JjM)\_\
  them compared to other research directions?\n\n* Whether to take a perspective of\
  \ curiosity driven basic science vs working towards specific goals\n\n* Whether\
  \ we can predict the key concepts represented in models well enough to find them\
  \ via supervised techniques such as [probing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12452&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752149274364716&usg=AOvVaw0GuH9ms0BFyjrOUHLgSBaf),\
  \ versus needing unsupervised techniques with the potential to surprise us, such\
  \ as [transcoders](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/attribution-graphs/biology.html&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752149274364882&usg=AOvVaw0I331-WixgzTld4VMU6fTc).\n\
  \nIn this workshop, we hope to bring together researchers from across these many\
  \ perspectives and communities\u2014along with skeptics, experts in adjacent fields,\
  \ and those simply curious to learn more\u2014to facilitate healthy discussion and\
  \ move towards a greater mutual understanding as a field.\n\n\nThrough our [call\
  \ for papers](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mechinterpworkshop.com/cfp/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1752149274365335&usg=AOvVaw0dVpFL_gCJJ9nE5i_PPWsh),\
  \ we hope to facilitate the sharing of work in this fast-moving field, across all\
  \ of these axes, and especially work that helps to bridge these gaps. We welcome\
  \ any submissions that seek to further our ability to use the internals of models\
  \ to achieve understanding, regardless of how unconventional the approach may be.\

  for further details and particular topics of interest.\n\n\nWe welcome attendees\
  \ from all backgrounds, regardless of your prior research experience or if you have\
  \ work published at this workshop. Note that while you do not need to be registered\
  \ for the NeurIPS main conference to attend this workshop, you do need to be registered\
  \ for the NeurIPS workshop track. No further registration (eg with this specific\
  \ workshop) is needed, just turn up on the day!\n\n\n## Learning More\n\nHere are\
